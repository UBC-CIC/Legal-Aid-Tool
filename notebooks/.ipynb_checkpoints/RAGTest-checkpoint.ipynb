      "\n",
      "The law student should ask the client about their income, expenses, assets, and debts to understand their financial situation. It is also important to inquire about their expectations regarding spousal support and child support. The law student should also ask about any prenuptial agreements or other agreements that may affect the division of assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Possible follow-up questions for the law student to ask the client: \n",
      "- Can you provide a detailed breakdown of your income and expenses? \n",
      "- Are there any specific assets you would like to retain, such as the family home or a business? \n",
      "- Have you and your spouse made any agreements about how to divide your assets or handle financial decisions during the marriage? \n",
      "- Are there any debts that you would like to prioritize paying off during the divorce? \n",
      "\n",
      "Legal implications to consider: The law student should be aware that the longer the marriage, the more likely it is that the court will consider the spouse's contributions to the marriage, including homemaking and child-rearing, when determining spousal support. Additionally, the law student should consider the impact of the divorce on the children, including the potential for a change in their living arrangements and access to both parents. \n",
