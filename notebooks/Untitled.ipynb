In this case, the essential elements of the offence include the application of force, intent to apply force, victim not consenting to force, and harm that is more than trifling. \n",
      "                 The accused's version of events suggests that he may be relying on a defence of self-defence. In this context, the accused would need to demonstrate that he reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of harm or that he was acting to protect himself from harm. \n",

      "                 - Did you feel that the victim was still a threat to you after you punched him in the stomach twice? \n",
      "                 - Can you explain why you did not try to leave the area or call for help after the altercation began? \n",
      "                 - Did the victim make any threats against you before the physical altercation began? \n",
      "                 - Did you notice any injuries or signs of distress on the victim's body after the altercation? \n",
      "                 - Did the victim say anything to you during or after the altercation that suggested he was not consenting to the physical contact? \n",
